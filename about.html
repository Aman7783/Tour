            <h3>Akshay Kumar</h3>
            <p><em>Kumar (born Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia on September 9, 1967) is an Indian film actor, producer and martial artist who
               has appeared in over a hundred Hindi films. He has been nominated for Filmfare Awards several times and won two times. 
               When he began his acting career in the 1990s, he primarily starred in action films and was particularly known for his 
               appearances in feature films commonly called the "Khiladi series", which included Khiladi (1992), Main Khiladi Tu Anari (1994), 
               Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995), Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996), Mr. and Mrs. Khiladi (1997), International Khiladi (1999), 
               Khiladi 420 (2000) and Khiladi 786 (2012).

                Early Life and Background
                Akshay Kumar was born in Amritsar in the Indian state of Punjab. His father was an army officer. His mother's name is
                Aruna Bhatia. From a very young age, he was recognised as a performer, particularly as a dancer. Kumar was raised in
                Delhi's Chandni Chowk neighbourhood before moving to Mumbai. In Mumbai, he lived in Koliwada, which was another Punjabi 
                dominated area. He studied at Don Bosco School in New Delhi and then Guru Nanak Khalsa College in Mumbai. Akshay has one
                sister also,Alka Bhatia.
                After having obtained a black belt in Taekwondo while in India, he studied martial arts in Bangkok, Thailand, 
                where he learned Muay Thai and worked as a chef and waiter. He then came back to Mumbai, where he started teaching 
                martial arts. One of his students happened to be a photographer and recommended him to do modelling.
                The student gave him a modelling assignment for a small company. For his two hours posing in front of the camera,
                Kumar got INR5,000, compared to his previous monthly salary of INR4,000. That was one of the main reasons 
                why he chose to be a model. One morning he missed his flight for an ad-shoot at Bangalore. Disappointed with himself,
                he went for his usual rounds at various film studios with his portfolio. Luckily that same evening, Kumar was signe
                for a lead role by producer Pramod Chakravarthy for the movie Deedar.
                
                Personal Life

                on September 25, 2012. Akshay stays in shape with a combination of kickboxing, basketball, swimming, parkour and other 
                sports, as well as working out.
                In the year 2004, he was honoured with the Rajiv Gandhi Award for his outstanding achievements in Bollywood.
                 In 2008 the University of Windsor in Ontario, Canada awarded him with Honorary Doctrate of Law for his outstanding 
                 work in the film industry and contribution to social work.
                The same year he was named the "Sexiest Man Alive" by People (India) magazine. The following year he was awarded the
                 highest Japanese honour of "Katana" and a sixth degree Black Belt in Kuyukai Gojuryu Karate. He was one of the

                  (born 9 September 1967),[4] known professionally as Akshay Kumar (pronounced [əkˈʂəj kʊˈmɑːɾ]), is an Indian-born
                naturalised Canadian[1][2][3] actor and film producer who works in Hindi cinema. In over 30 years of acting, Kumar 
                has appeared in over 100 films and has won several awards, including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards.
                 He received the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. 
                 Kumar is one of the most prolific actors in Indian cinema.[5][6] Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both 
                 highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020.[7][8] Between 2019 and 2020, 
                 he was the only Indian on both lists.[9][10][11]

                Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the action
                thriller Khiladi. The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in the Khiladi 
                film series, in addition to other action films such as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his early tryst
                with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar expanded his range
                of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003), Namastey London (2007),
                and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri (2000), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi 
                (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar won Filmfare Awards for
                his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam Masala (2005).
                  
                While his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success soared in 2007 with four consecutive box-office
                hits; it was consistent until a short period of decline between 2009 and 2011, after which he reinforced his status
                with several films, including Rowdy Rathore (2012) and Holiday (2014). Moreover, around this time critical response 
                to several of his films improved; his work in Special 26 (2013), Baby (2015) and Airlift (2016) was acclaimed, 
                and he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the crime thriller Rustom (2016). He earned further notice
                for his self-produced social films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017) and Pad Man (2018), as well as the war film Kesari 
                (2019), and set box-office records in 2019 with Mission Mangal, Housefull 4, Good Newwz, and the 2021 action film 
                Sooryavanshi.
                  
                  In addition to acting, Kumar has worked as a stunt actor.[a] In 2008, He started hosting Fear Factor:
                   Khatron Ke Khiladi and hosted four seasons. He also launched the TV reality show Dare 2 Dance in 2014 and 
                   his off-screen work includes ownership of the team Khalsa Warriors in the World Kabaddi League. The actor had
                    also set up martial arts training schools for women safety in the country.[13][14] Kumar is one of the India's 
                    most philanthropic actor and supports various charities. He is a leading brand endorser celebrity in India.[15]
                  
                  Sometime during or after the 2011 Canadian federal election, the Conservative government granted Canadian citizenship
                   to Kumar by invoking a little-known law which allowed circumventing the usual residency requirement for Canadian
                    immigrants.[1] According to a former Conservative Party minister, Tony Clement, the citizenship was awarded in 
                    return for Kumar's offer of putting his "star power to use to advance Canada-Indian relations", and Canada's
                 "trade relations, commercial relations, in the movie sector, in the tourism sector".Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the action
